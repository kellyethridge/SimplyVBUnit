** SimplyVBUnit: Movie Business DLL Example **

This group of projects demonstrates how to test business classes
contained in a DLL. It is not a complete application, but does show
some of the methods that are used for testing classes. This is not
an exhaustive example, just enough to demonstrate common testing
methods using SimplyVBUnit 4.
